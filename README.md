## Installation

To install a Dialogic, download it as a ZIP archive. All releases are listed here: [releases](https://github.com/coppolaemilio/dialogic/releases). Then extract the ZIP archive and move the `addons/` folder it contains into your project folder. Then, enable the plugin in project settings.

If you want to know more about installing plugins you can read the [Godot docs page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).

You can also install Dialogic using the **AssetLib** tab in the editor, but the version here will not be the latest one available since it takes some time for it to be approved.
